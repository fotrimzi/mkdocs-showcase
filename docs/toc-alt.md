# Automatic ToC

Reference: <https://github.com/lukasgeiter/mkdocs-awesome-pages-plugin>

## About

This plugin saves having to define a `nav:` element.

It has configuration options (in `.pages` files) for hiding directories, overriding some
of the automation, and collapsing the contents of directories.

## Install & Configure

```bash
pip3 install mkdocs-awesome-pages-plugin
```

```yaml
plugins:
    - search
    - awesome-pages
```
