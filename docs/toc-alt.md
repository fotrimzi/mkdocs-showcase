# Auto ToC

- Plugin: <https://github.com/lukasgeiter/mkdocs-awesome-pages-plugin>
- Test: **PASS**

## About

This plugin saves having to have a `nav:` element.

It has configuration options (in `.pages` files) for hiding directories, overriding some
of the automation, and collapsing the contents of directories.

TODO needs more investigation

Useful but results in unpredictable navbars.

## Install

```
pip3 install mkdocs-awesome-pages-plugin
```

### Configure

Remove `nav:` elements.

```
plugins:
    - search
    - awesome-pages
```
