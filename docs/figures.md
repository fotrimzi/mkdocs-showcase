# Figures

## Notes

Sphinx can include an image as a captioned figure.

To do that in Markdown, use this plugin to write the equivalent HTML:

<https://github.com/stuebersystems/mkdocs-img2fig-plugin>


!!! important
    This plugin converts ALL images into figures.

## Install & Configure

```bash
pip3 install mkdocs-img2fig-plugin
```

```yaml
plugins:
    - search
    - img2fig
```
