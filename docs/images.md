## Usage

```md
![Test Card](/img/BBCHD_testcard_big.jpg)
```

![Test Card](/img/BBCHD_testcard_big.jpg)

!!! note

    MkDocs copies everything in the source directory 
    (default `docs`) that isn't a `.md` file, so images 
    can be put in any directory you choose so long as 
    it is within `docs`.
